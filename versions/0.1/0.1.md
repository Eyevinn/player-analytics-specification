## Terminology

`session` - A session means the viewing session of some particular content so `sessionId` refers to the unique viewing session of some content.

## Event flow

Any analytics specification needs a solid & reliable event flow, it is crucial that the following events are implemented correctly for the backend to reliably be able to churn out good session data.

Events SHOULD be batched together and sent in intervals, the interval duration MUST be the `heartbeatInterval` from the `init` event response. 
Events that have not been sent when the session stops MUST be sent regardless of interval.

### JSON Schema

Single event
```jsonc
{
  event: "event_enum",
  sessionId: "UID" 
  timestamp: 1634911668339, // UTC time. The client SHOULD send valid UTC time.

  playhead: 0, // The current playhead position in milliseconds, if the content is Live should be UTC time. -1 if unknown
  duration: 0, // The duration of the content in milliseconds. VOD = length of stream, Live = live edge in UTC. -1 if unknown 
  payload?: {
    // Unique to each event
    // If needed additional custom fields may be added here as well but the server MAY ignore them. 
  }
}
```

Batched events
```jsonc
{
  sessionId: "UID",
  events: [{
    type: "event enum",
    timestamp: 1634911668339, // UTC time. The client SHOULD send valid UTC time.

    playhead: 0, // The current playhead position in milliseconds, if the content is Live should be UTC time. -1 if unknown
    duration: 0, // The duration of the content in milliseconds. VOD = length of stream, Live = live edge in UTC. -1 if unknown 
    payload?: {
      // Unique to each event
      // If needed additional custom fields may be added here as well but the server MAY ignore them. 
    }
  }]
}
```

### Flowchart

### Events

#### init

Sent just before the player starts loading the contentUrl.
MUST be sent ONCE per session. CANNOT be batched

```jsonc
{
  event: "init",
  sessionId?: "" // if not provided the server MUST generate it
  timestamp: -1,
  playhead: -1, // if the player has an expected startTime, eg. if user continues watches a movie, use that value here.
  duration: -1,
  payload: {
    live: false,
    contentId: "",
    contentUrl: "",
    drmType?: "",
    userId?: "", 
    deviceId?: ""
    deviceModel?: ""
    deviceType?: ""
    ... // additional parameters can be added as needed, however the server may choose to ignore them.
  }
}
```

The `init` event is the only event that actually receives a JSON response from the server
```jsonc
{
  sessionId: ''
  heartbeatInterval: 30, 
}
```

After the init response the client MUST send the heartbeat event at the provided interval, until the session has ended.

#### heartbeat

Sent at a fixed interval using the provided value from the `init` event response.

```jsonc
{
  event: "heartbeat",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0,
}
```
 
#### loading

Sent when the contentUrl has been attached to the client player.
MUST be sent ONCE per session.

```jsonc
{
  event: "loading",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```


#### loaded

This is sent when there is enough buffered content for the player to play the contentUrl.
MUST be sent ONCE per session.

```jsonc
{
  event: "loaded",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```

#### play

Sent as soon as player request that playback starts, eg. when the user presses play or when autoplay kicks in.
MUST be sent ONCE per session.

```jsonc
{
  event: "play",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```


#### playing

Sent when playback starts, when the playhead starts to move.
MUST be sent ONCE per session.

```jsonc
{
  event: "playing",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```


#### pause

Sent when the player is paused due to a pause request ( not because the playhead stopped moving )

```jsonc
{
  event: "pause",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```

#### resume

Sent when the player resume playback after a pause.

```jsonc
{
  event: "resume",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```

#### buffering

Sent when the player starts buffering, should not be sent when seeking or loading.

```jsonc
{
  event: "buffering",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```

#### buffered

Sent when the player resumes playback after buffering. If buffering is interrupted for any reason this MUST be sent with the payload `interrupted: true` 

```jsonc
{
  event: "buffered",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
  payload: {
    interrupted?: boolean
  }
}
```

#### seeking

This is sent when the player starts seeking to a new playhead time. `playhead` MUST be the current playhead time NOT the target playhead time. Should not be sent during `loading`.

```jsonc
{
  event: "seeking",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```

#### seeked

Sent when the player starts seeking to a new playhead time. `playhead` MUST be new playhead time.

```jsonc
{
  event: "seeked",
  sessionId: "",
  timestamp: 0,
  playhead: 0,
  duration: 0
}
```

#### bitrate_changed

Sent when the player switches between different ABR levels.

```jsonc
{
  event: "bitrate_changed",
  payload: {
    bitrate: "", // bitrate in Kbps
    width?: "", // video width in pixels
    height?: "", // video height in pixels
    videoBitrate?: "", // if available provide the bitrate for the video track
    audioBitrate?: "", // if available provide the bitrate for the audio track
  }
}
```

#### stopped

Sent when playback stops for whatever reason.

```jsonc
{
  event: "stopped",
  payload: {
    reason?: "" // eg. "ended", "aborted", "error"
  }
}
```

#### error

Sent when a fatal error occurs, if the player does not recover from this error the `stopped` event SHOULD be sent with `reason: "error"`.

```jsonc
{
  event: "error",
  payload: {
    category?: "", // eg. NETWORK, DECODER, etc.
    code: "",
    message?: "", 
    data?: {} 
  }
}
```

#### warn

Sent when a non-fatal error occurs, eg. a subtitle track doesn't work but the player is still able to play the content or a playback error that the player can recover
from without interruption.

```jsonc
{
  event: "warn",
  payload: {
    category?: "", // eg. NETWORK, DECODER, osv.
    code "",
    message?: "",
    data?: {} 
  }
}
```
