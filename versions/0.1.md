## Event flow

Any analytics specification needs a solid & reliable event flow, it is crucial that the following events are implemented correctly for the backend to reliably be able to churn out good session data.

### init

This is the first event that needs to be sent, this should be sent just before the player starts loading the contentUrl.

```
{
  event: "init",
  payload: {
    contentUrl: "",
    userId: ""
  }
}
```
